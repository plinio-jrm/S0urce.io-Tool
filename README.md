# S0urce.io Tool
I posted the entire code i made using Visual Studio 2017 here. The project is a **Windows Application Form**. You can create and use the same source to compile your own tool if you don't trust the tool on [releases folder](https://github.com/plinio-jrm/S0urce.io-Tool/tree/master/Releases "Releases").

#### Description
Tired of typing? Here the solution! I created this Tool (Bot), so you can join and relax recking everyone! At first you'll require to input the hacking words you see in the command window. You will have to type only once. 
##### Don't worry: If you type it wrong, the tool will let it strike twice before asking you to type the word again.

### Warning
Please be aware that this is a personal project. Use it on your own. If you get banned, it's your responsability!

### Observation
this project will be maintained as long the game maintain as a HTML based game. Whenever it change to flash, js or others, i'll stop maintaining it.

### How it works
It is a Windows application with a browser component in it. the application uses a class to overwatch over the window components of the game, since the game completely uses HTML. It have a automated hacking process that makes (you lazy) easy for you to overcome others.
